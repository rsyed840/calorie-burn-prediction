# calorie-burn-prediction

 in this project, we delve into a fascinating machine learning project that focuses on predicting the number of calories burnt during physical exercise. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset comprising exercise patterns and corresponding calorie measurements, we unlock the potential to gain valuable insights into optimizing workouts and achieving fitness goals.

We start by providing an overview of the dataset, which consists of two primary components: the "calories" dataset and the "exercise" dataset. Through careful data preprocessing techniques, we handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split the data into training and testing sets. These critical steps set the foundation for our subsequent analysis.

Next, we embark on an exploratory data analysis journey, where we uncover hidden relationships and patterns within the dataset. Through captivating visualizations such as bar plots, box plots, scatter plots, we visualize the impact of variables such as gender, age, duration, heart rate, and body temperature on calorie burn.

The heart of the project lies in model training and evaluation. We leverage various regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression, to predict calorie burn based on exercise features. Performance evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score help us assess and compare the models' effectiveness.

Finally, we highlight the significance of model deployment by saving the best-performing model using the Pickle library. This ensures that the trained model can be easily loaded and utilized to predict calorie burn for new input data.
